# Bit_Adder
Simulate operation in binary (coded in java)

Operation possible + / - / *

ex: 12 + 4

The program will reconize the operation to do, then it will convert the decimal in binary, realize the operation in 
binary and output the result in binary. It will also output the decimal result.

Can't realize division yet..
